            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <h3>Introduction to Weightlifting</h3>
            <p>Weightlifting, also known as Olympic weightlifting, is a sport in which athletes attempt to lift the maximum weight possible in a single lift of a barbell loaded with weight plates. It is one of the oldest competitive sports and has been a part of the modern Olympic Games since their inception in 1896.</p>

            <h3>History of Weightlifting</h3>
            <h4>Ancient Origins</h4>
            <p><strong>Ancient Greece and Egypt:</strong> Early forms of weightlifting can be traced back to ancient civilizations like Greece and Egypt, where lifting heavy stones and objects was a test of strength.</p>
            <p><strong>China:</strong> Historical records show that weightlifting was practiced in ancient China as a way to evaluate a person's physical prowess and health.</p>

            <h4>Modern Development</h4>
            <p><strong>19th Century:</strong> Weightlifting as a competitive sport began to take shape in Europe in the late 19th century, with organized competitions emerging in countries like Austria and Germany.</p>
            <p><strong>Olympic Inclusion:</strong> The sport was included in the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. Initially, the competition included one- and two-handed lifts.</p>
            <img src="2.jpeg" alt="Image 2">

            <p><strong>Evolution:</strong> The sport evolved over the years, with the establishment of weight classes and standardized lifts. The two primary lifts, the snatch and the clean and jerk, were standardized in the mid-20th century.</p>

            <h3>Basic Rules and Gameplay Mechanics</h3>
            <h4>The Lifts</h4>
            <p><strong>Snatch:</strong> The athlete lifts the barbell from the ground to overhead in one continuous motion. The lift requires a combination of strength, speed, and technique.</p>
            <p><strong>Clean and Jerk:</strong> This lift is divided into two parts. First, the athlete lifts the barbell from the ground to the shoulders (clean). Then, they push the barbell overhead (jerk). It is considered the ultimate test of strength and technique.</p>

            <h4>Competition Structure</h4>
            <p><strong>Weight Classes:</strong> Athletes compete in different weight classes to ensure fair competition.</p>
            <p><strong>Attempts:</strong> Each lifter is allowed three attempts in both the snatch and the clean and jerk. The best successful lift in each is combined to determine the athlete's total score.</p>
            <p><strong>Order of Lifting:</strong> Athletes lift in a predetermined order based on their declared starting weights. The athlete with the lowest declared weight lifts first.</p>
            <p><strong>Tiebreakers:</strong> In case of a tie, the lifter with the lower body weight wins. If still tied, the lifter who achieved the total weight first is declared the winner.</p>

            <h4>Technical Rules</h4>
            <p><strong>Lift Execution:</strong> The lifts must be executed according to strict technical rules. For instance, the barbell must be lifted in a continuous motion, and the lifter must maintain control of the barbell throughout the lift.</p>
            <p><strong>Judging:</strong> Three referees judge each lift. A lift is deemed successful if at least two of the three referees signal a good lift by pressing a white button.</p>
            <p><strong>Fouls:</strong> Lifts can be disqualified for reasons such as incomplete extension, touching the platform with any part of the body other than the feet, or lowering the barbell before receiving the referee's signal.</p>

            <h3>Weightlifting Equipment</h3>
            <p><strong>Barbell:</strong> The standard barbell weighs 20 kg for men and 15 kg for women. The barbell includes rotating sleeves to reduce the torque on the lifter's wrists.</p>
            <img src="3.jpeg" alt="Image 3" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

            <p><strong>Weight Plates:</strong> Plates come in various weights and are color-coded for easy identification. They are added to the barbell to achieve the desired lifting weight.</p>
            <p><strong>Collars:</strong> These are used to secure the weight plates on the barbell.</p>
            <p><strong>Lifting Platform:</strong> The platform is typically 4 meters by 4 meters and is designed to provide a stable and safe surface for lifting.</p>

            <h3>Benefits of Weightlifting</h3>
            <p><strong>Strength and Power:</strong> Weightlifting is excellent for building overall strength and power.</p>
            <p><strong>Technique and Coordination:</strong> The lifts require precise technique and coordination, improving an athlete's motor skills.</p>
            <p><strong>Flexibility and Balance:</strong> The sport enhances flexibility and balance, as the lifts require a full range of motion and stability.</p>

            <p>Weightlifting is a dynamic and challenging sport that combines physical strength with technical skill. Its rich history and strict rules ensure a fair and exciting competition for both athletes and spectators.</p>
